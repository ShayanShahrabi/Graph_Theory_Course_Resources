# Suggested Resources [Persian]
- [Combinatorics – Preparation for Round 2](https://maktabkhooneh.org/course/%D8%AA%D8%B1%DA%A9%DB%8C%D8%A8%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A2%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AF%DA%AF%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AD%D9%84%D9%87-%DB%B2-mk158/#chapter) [Persian]  

  These videos are prepared by the Iranian National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents for the second round of the Iranian Mathematical Olympiad.  
  Among them, the graph theory lectures by Dr. Hesam Firoozi are highly recommended, though the exercises may be a bit more advanced than standard course material.  

- [Iranian Mathematical Olympiad – Round 3 Videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nQPCiQNcXYcfq9vMToFRSK6nHBia7P_N) [Persian]  

  This Google Drive folder contains third-round Olympiad preparation videos.  
  In the *Combinatorics* section under *Lectures*, you can find sessions by Dr. Alireza Alipour and Dr. Hesam Firoozi.  
  The *Problem Solving* section also includes solution videos, though the difficulty is generally above the classroom level.  

- [Graph Theory Course – Isfahan University of Technology](https://maktabkhooneh.org/course/%D8%A2%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%B4-%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%87-%DA%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81-mk1076/) [Persian]  

  This course, taught by Dr. Behnaz Omoumi, introduces key concepts and theorem proofs.  
  Note that the focus is on definitions and proofs only — no problem-solving is included.
