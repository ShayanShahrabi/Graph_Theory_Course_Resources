\section*{Problems}

\subsection*{Problem 1: Exactly 2 Odd Vertices}
Suppose that in a graph $G$, there are exactly 2 odd vertices. Prove that there must be a path between these 2 odd nodes.

\subsection*{Problem 2: Minimum Length of a Path}
Prove that in a graph $G$, there exists a path of length at least $\delta$.

\subsection*{Problem 3: Really Simple}
Prove that in every graph $G$, the following equation holds:
\begin{equation*}
\delta \le \frac{2m}{n} \le \Delta
\end{equation*}

\subsection*{Problem 4: Triangle Inequality}
Prove that for any 3 nodes $x$, $y$, and $z$ in a graph $G$, the following inequality holds:
\begin{equation*}
d(x,y) + d(x,z) \ge d(x,z)
\end{equation*}

\subsection*{Problem 5: How to Stay Connected?}
Prove that if $G$ is self-complementary, then it is connected.

\subsection*{Problem 6: Edge-Vertex Relationship in Simple Connected Graphs}
Suppose in a simple and connected graph $G$, we have $diam(G) = 2$ and $\Delta = n - 2$. Prove that
\begin{equation*}
m \ge 2n - 4
\end{equation*}
where $n$ is the number of vertices and $m$ is the number of edges in $G$.

\subsection*{Problem 7: Bonus Question}
\textcolor{red}{\textit{Note: Your solution for the bonus question will be reviewed only after you have solved all the previous questions, and I have approved your solution. Moreover, keep in mind that you must communicate your solution in person; otherwise, no points will be awarded!}}

Suppose $V = {A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_n}$ is a subset of $n$ points in space, such that the distance between any two points is at least 1. Prove that at most $3n$ pairs of these points can have distances exactly equal to 1.
